<h2>project_Fault-Detection</h2>
<p>
  This project combines Verilog simulation and machine learning to detect faults in digital logic circuits such as adders, multiplexers, and counters. We simulate both clean and faulty circuits, extract waveform data, convert it to structured datasets, and train ML models to classify behavior as correct or faulty.
