<h2>CNN-Accelerator</h2>
<p>
  This project implements a hardware accelerator for a 3Ã—3 convolution layer, a fundamental operation in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Using Verilog, we design and simulate the convolution block, process image inputs, and validate behavior against a Python-based NumPy model.
