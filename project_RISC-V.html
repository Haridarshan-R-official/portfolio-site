<h2>project_RISC-V</h2>
<p>
  This project implements a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU with an integrated machine learning-based branch predictor. The goal is to simulate and analyze branch misprediction scenarios and enhance prediction accuracy using a trained ML model that leverages dynamic branch history.
