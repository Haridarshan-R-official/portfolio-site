<h2>Image-Compression-Using-DCT</h2>
<p>
  This project implements a basic image compression pipeline using 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) in Verilog, followed by a Python-based quality predictor trained via Machine Learning. The DCT hardware module compresses grayscale image blocks, and an ML model estimates image quality metrics like PSNR or SSIM after compression.
